# Quest + Minigame Integration Test

Welcome to the Quest and Minigame Integration Test!

This test will show how quests can trigger minigames and how the results affect quest progression.

@startQuest questId:"tutorial_quest"

Great! I've started the tutorial quest. Let's complete the first task:

@completeTask "tutorial_quest" task:"talk_to_npc"

Excellent! Now we're at the minigame task. Let's play the pairs minigame:

@minigame gameid:"pairs" resultvar:minigameResult

@if minigameResult
    Great job! You completed the minigame successfully!
    Now let's complete the minigame task in the quest:
    
    @completeTask "tutorial_quest" task:"play_minigame"
    
    @if HasCompletedTask("tutorial_quest" "play_minigame")
        Perfect! The minigame task is now complete.
        Your current task is: {GetCurrentTaskDescription("tutorial_quest")}
    @endif
@else
    Oh no! You didn't complete the minigame. Let's try again:
    
    @minigame gameid:"pairs" resultvar:minigameResult2
    
    @if minigameResult2
        Great! Second time's the charm!
        @completeTask "tutorial_quest" task:"play_minigame"
    @else
        Don't worry, you can try again later. The quest will wait for you.
    @endif
@endif

Now let's complete the final task:

@completeTask "tutorial_quest" task:"visit_location"

@if IsQuestCompleted("tutorial_quest")
    Congratulations! You've completed the entire tutorial quest!
    This demonstrates how quests can integrate with minigames for a more interactive experience.
