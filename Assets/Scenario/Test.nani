Welcome to the Quest System Test!

Let's start by creating a simple quest for you.

@startQuest questId:"tutorial_quest"

Great! I've started the "Tutorial Quest" for you.
@showUI QuestSystemUI
@if IsQuestActive("tutorial_quest")
    The quest is now active! Your current task is: {GetCurrentTaskDescription("tutorial_quest")}
@else
    Something went wrong with starting the quest.
@endif

Now let's complete the first task:

@completeTask "tutorial_quest" task:"talk_to_npc"

@if "HasCompletedTask("tutorial_quest", "talk_to_npc")"
    Excellent! You've completed the "Talk to NPC" task.
@else
    Task completion didn't work properly.
@endif

Let's check your current task again:

@if IsQuestActive("tutorial_quest")
    Your current task is: {GetCurrentTaskDescription("tutorial_quest")}
@endif

Now let's complete the second task:

@completeTask "tutorial_quest" task:"play_minigame"

@if HasCompletedTask("tutorial_quest" "play_minigame")
    Great! You've completed the minigame task.
@endif

Let's complete the final task:

@completeTask "tutorial_quest" task:"visit_location"

@if IsQuestCompleted("tutorial_quest")
    Congratulations! You've completed the entire tutorial quest!
@else
    @if IsQuestActive("tutorial_quest")
        You still have tasks remaining: {GetCurrentTaskDescription("tutorial_quest")}
    @else
        Something went wrong with the quest completion.
    @endif
@endif

# Testing Quest Persistence

Let's test if the quest state persists. I'll start a new quest:

@startQuest questId:"advanced_quest"

@if IsQuestActive("advanced_quest")
    Advanced quest started! Current task: {GetCurrentTaskDescription("advanced_quest")}
@endif

@completeTask "advanced_quest" task:"collect_item"

@if HasCompletedTask("advanced_quest" "collect_item")
    Item collected successfully!
@endif
